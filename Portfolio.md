Need: My game will provide a storyline where a hero saves people that are in need of help. Through playing my game children at the ages of 4 to 10 can obtain improvements in their hand-eye coordination because there is due to be simple fighting movements. Children can also improve their creativity thanks to the storyline which will also provide entertainment for the children.

Problem Statement: Children at the ages of 4 to 10 is a good time to develop or improve their skills, such as hand-eye coordination and  creativity. This can be accomplished through playing my game where a hero saves people in need of help. On the way there will be monsters that can be tackled through simple fighting. The 2D game will be made on a 2D Platformer and will provide amusing graphics for the children which will keep them entertained while improving their skills.

Skill Development: To make this game in Unity I will obtain help from the tutorial videos in the google classroom.

#### Requirements outline:
Inputs: 
In order to achieve moving the character, the user would have to use the arrow keys or WASD. Fighting would be possible by clicking on the mouse, the right click and left click will be different movements.

Processing:
The program for my game will check for collisions and will be regularly updated so that there is a minimum chance of bugs in the game. 

Outputs:
The game will display the character's position and certain messages, such as the game-over message, the aim of the round, etc. The game will also provide music that will calm the user while playing the game.

Transmission:
My game will not require network communication or multiplayer support.

Storage:
The game will store the game progress and user settings privately. If the user deletes the game then the progress will be lost.

#### Functional requirements:
User interaction:
The user will interact with the character in the game by using keyboard controls and the mouse. Through this the user can move the character and fight the monsters and select options in the game. WASD and the arrow keys will be movement while mouse clicks will be fighting. 

Core gameplay or simulation mechanics:
The core actions of my game is fighting monsters. The monster would be either up high or down low and would be blocking the characters path. In order to get rid of the monster the user would have to either right click or left click to defeat it. Right click would be used to defeat monsters that are up high and left click would be used to defeat monsters that are down low. Different animations will be shown depending on the attack the character has done. 

Scoring and feedback:
My game will send feedback to the user when they have reached the end of the round. The message will be short and explain what the theme of the round was. For example, "Great Job! You saved Miss Petty's cat!". If the user has failed to reach the end of the round a message will be displayed as a comfort. For example, "It's ok, maybe next time you can save Miss Petty's cat!".

Level progression or simulation stages:
In my game there will be levels that can be accessed after the user presses the play button in the splash screen. A screen will pop up after pressing the button displaying the level numbers like bloxel rebound and fire-boy and water-girl. The levels will be numbered and can only be accomplised numerically. For example, if the user does not complete level 3 they cannot play level 4. When the user has finished a level they will be taken back to the screen with all of the level numbers.

Saving and loading data:
My game will save the game progress of the user and settings on the user's device. If the user deletes the game then the progress will be lost with it.
